## Bugs
### Solved Bugs
 * When I wrote the project, the totals kept going to the zero value. I fixed this by putting it all in the function game_choice.
 * If the user wrote a word and then the wrong number it did not work. I fixed this by adding a while statement to the except statement. 
 * When user does not add an input twice in a row the program crashed. I fixed this by taking away the second try and except. 
 
### Remaining Bugs
 * No bugs remain

### Validator Testing
 * PEP8
  * No errors were returned from PEP8online.com
